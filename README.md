# Customer and Employee Management System
I created a Java application where an admin can manage customers and employees easily. In this system, customers can buy products, 
and the admin can add or remove employees, view their details, and check customer information. The app has a simple structure, starts with some sample data,
and opens through a main menu where all features can be used.
